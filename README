== Setup
1) bundle install
2) Rename config/docusign.example.yml => docusign.yml and, if necessary, change the endpoint urls.
3) rake db:migrate

== Items of interest
* docusign.yml is read in config/initializers/docusign.rb
* lib/loan_co.rb contains the LoanCo module. This is used throughout the application
  to store a connection to the Docusign API.
* the Docusign gem contains some convenient features which make calling the Docusign API
  much more Ruby-like. You can see these in action throughout this application.
  Refer to the Docusign gem RDoc for more information
